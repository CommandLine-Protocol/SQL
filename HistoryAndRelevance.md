# history, evolution, and why it’s relevant today.

## **1. History of SQL**

- **1970 – The Concept**
  - IBM researcher **Edgar F. Codd** introduced the **relational database model** in a paper called _“A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks”_.
  - This was the foundation for SQL. Codd proposed that data could be stored in tables and manipulated using a standard language.

- **1974–1979 – Early Development**
  - IBM developed a language called **SEQUEL** (Structured English Query Language) to work with their experimental **System R** database.
  - SEQUEL was later shortened to **SQL** due to trademark reasons.

- **1980s – Standardization Begins**
  - **ANSI (American National Standards Institute)** and **ISO (International Organization for Standardization)** standardized SQL in **1986**, making it the official language for relational databases.
  - This allowed different database systems to use SQL with slight variations.

- **1990s–Present – Widespread Adoption**
  - SQL became the dominant language for relational databases.
  - Most major databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, SQLite) use SQL as the main language for queries.
  - Modern extensions added features like procedural programming, triggers, and JSON support.

## **2. Relevance of SQL Today**

SQL is **extremely relevant** because:

1. **Universal Database Language**
   - Almost all relational databases use SQL. Learning it allows you to work with many systems (PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL).

2. **Data is Everywhere**
   - Companies, schools, apps, and governments store huge amounts of structured data. SQL is the language to query and manage this data efficiently.

3. **Powerful Yet Simple**
   - SQL allows you to perform complex operations with relatively simple commands (like filtering, joining tables, aggregating data).

4. **Industry Demand**
   - SQL is a fundamental skill for **data analysts, software developers, data engineers, and backend developers**.
   - Even big data systems (like Hive, BigQuery) use SQL-like syntax.

5. **Interoperability**
   - SQL works well with other programming languages. For example, you can use Python, Java, or JavaScript to interact with SQL databases.

### **In Short**

SQL is **the standard language for relational databases**, developed from IBM research in the 1970s, standardized in the 1980s, and still widely used today because data is everywhere and relational databases are fundamental to almost all software systems.
