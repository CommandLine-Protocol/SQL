**Day 3** is where SQL becomes **job-powerful**. This is the day interviewers care about most. You move from “retrieving rows” → to **analyzing data**. 💯

# 🟢 DAY 3 – Aggregations (Critical for Jobs) (4 Hours)

# ⏱ Hour 1 – Aggregate Functions (Academic + Practical Depth)

Aggregation means:

> Taking many rows and producing a single summarized value.

---

## 1️⃣ COUNT()

Counts rows.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;
```

Counts all rows including NULL values.

Count specific column:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(purchases) FROM users;
```

---

## 2️⃣ SUM()

Adds numeric values.

```sql
SELECT SUM(purchases) FROM users;
```

---

## 3️⃣ AVG()

Returns mean value.

```sql
SELECT AVG(age) FROM users;
```

---

## 4️⃣ MIN() and MAX()

```sql
SELECT MIN(age), MAX(age) FROM users;
```

---

## 🔬 Academic Understanding

Aggregate functions:

- Collapse multiple rows
- Return one result (unless grouped)
- Ignore NULL values (except COUNT(\*))

Internally:

Database engine:

1. Scans rows
2. Applies function accumulator
3. Returns final result

For large datasets:
Indexes may help MIN/MAX
But SUM/AVG usually require scanning relevant rows.

# ⏱ Hour 2 – GROUP BY (Core Concept)

This is where SQL thinking changes.

---

## What GROUP BY Does

It changes result structure.

Instead of:
“One result for whole table”

You get:
“One result per group”

---

## Example Dataset

Make sure your users table includes purchases and country.

---

### Example 1 – Count users per country

```sql
SELECT country, COUNT(*)
FROM users
GROUP BY country;
```

Output:

| country | count |
| ------- | ----- |
| USA     | 3     |
| UK      | 2     |

---

## Why GROUP BY Is Strict

Every selected column must either:

- Be aggregated
- Or be inside GROUP BY

This fails:

```sql
SELECT country, age
FROM users
GROUP BY country;
```

Why?

Because SQL doesn’t know which age to pick.

---

## HAVING (Very Important)

HAVING filters AFTER grouping.

Example:

```sql
SELECT country, COUNT(*)
FROM users
GROUP BY country
HAVING COUNT(*) > 2;
```

WHERE filters rows.
HAVING filters groups.

Execution order:

1. FROM
2. WHERE
3. GROUP BY
4. HAVING
5. SELECT
6. ORDER BY

# ⏱ Hour 3 – Business Problem Simulation

Now we think like a company.

## 1️⃣ Top Customers

```sql
SELECT name, purchases
FROM users
ORDER BY purchases DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

---

## 2️⃣ Total Purchases Per Country

```sql
SELECT country, SUM(purchases)
FROM users
GROUP BY country;
```

---

## 3️⃣ Average Age Per Country

```sql
SELECT country, AVG(age)
FROM users
GROUP BY country;
```

---

## 4️⃣ Countries With High Engagement

```sql
SELECT country, SUM(purchases)
FROM users
GROUP BY country
HAVING SUM(purchases) > 10;
```

---

## 5️⃣ Most Recent Signup Year

```sql
SELECT MAX(signup_year) FROM users;
```

---

## 6️⃣ Every user who signed up in the most recent year

```sql
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE signup_year = (SELECT MAX(signup_year) FROM users);
```

---

# ⏱ Hour 4 – Deep Academic Understanding

## Why GROUP BY Changes Result Shape

Without GROUP BY:

Rows → Single summary

With GROUP BY:

Rows → Buckets → Summary per bucket

This is similar to:

MapReduce pattern in distributed systems.

---

## Internal Execution Model (Simplified)

When you run:

```sql
SELECT country, COUNT(*)
FROM users
GROUP BY country;
```

Database:

1. Reads rows
2. Hashes or sorts by country
3. Creates aggregation buckets
4. Maintains counters
5. Outputs grouped result

Two strategies:

- Hash aggregation
- Sort aggregation

We revisit this when discussing indexes.

# 🧪 Practice Questions (Solve Without Looking at Solutions)

### 1️⃣ Beginner

Count total users.

### 2️⃣ Beginner+

Find average age of users.

### 3️⃣ Intermediate

Find total purchases made by users from USA.

### 4️⃣ Intermediate+

Find number of users per signup_year.

### 5️⃣ Advanced

Find countries where average age is greater than 28.

### 6️⃣ Advanced+

Find the signup_year with the highest number of users.
(Hint: GROUP BY + ORDER BY + LIMIT)

### 7️⃣ Interview Classic

Find the second highest age in the table.
(You may use ORDER BY + LIMIT with offset in PostgreSQL/MySQL.)

# 🧠 Conceptual Test Questions (Academic Level)

### 1️⃣ Why does COUNT(column) ignore NULL values?

### 2️⃣ What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING?

### 3️⃣ Why does SQL require grouped columns to appear in GROUP BY?

### 4️⃣ How does aggregation scale with large datasets?

### 5️⃣ What is the difference between COUNT(\*) and COUNT(column)?
